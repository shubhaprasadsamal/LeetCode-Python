#
# Why Trees?
# 1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer:
#
# file system
# -----------
# /    <-- root
# / \
#     ...       home
# / \
#     ugrad        course
# /       /      | \
#     ...      cs101  cs112  cs113
# 2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).
# 3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).
# 4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.
#
# Main applications of trees include:
# 1. Manipulate hierarchical data.
# 2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal).
# 3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.
# 4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.
# 5. Router algorithms
# 6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).
#
# Binary Tree: A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree.
# Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
